I've seen many people asking, "Which language should I learn first?" when it comes to programming. Some have an idea of what they want to do with it, but some don't.  
I created this website using React.js with an interactive quiz based on this flowchart here: http://carlcheo.com/startcoding  
While the flowchart is somewhat dated, it still provides a good pointer for beginners who want to get into coding but don't know which language to learn.
